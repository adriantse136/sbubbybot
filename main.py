The Karma minimum is to help prevent spam and is undisclosed to prevent trolls and spammers. **If your message is not about the required amount of karma but is for an approval request or another topic, don't worry, a human moderator will respond shortly.** However, you can go through our manual exemption process instead to post content as long as you make original sbubbies. The process is as follows:
                    
                    1. Message us with a link to your removed post. **Don't delete your post, we won't be able to review or approve it if you delete it.**
                    
                    1. A moderator will review your submission and asks questions if needed. If it can't be approved, we will explain how to make it acceptable to approve.
                    
                    1. If the submission is accepted, you will receive a reply telling you your submission was approved. If you've completed the process 3 times successfully, you will receive an alert telling you that you are an approved user.
                    
                    **Please note that you can only go through this process if you only post original sbubbies.**
