For those out of the loop: Sunday Sbubday is a weekly event attempting to bring back and make Eef Freef (nonsensical) and Eeble Freeble (surreal) edits more common! **During this time, only nonsensical and surreal edits are allowed (see FAQ below for more details and information). Others such as those that make some sense (Eaten Fresh) and logoswaps will be removed.**

Quick FAQ:

>**When does Sunday Sbubday start?**

It starts 00:00 Eastern Time every Sunday. If you posted at exactly this time you'll still be let through but other posters won't be. It will end at 23:59 EST.

>**What is an Eef Freef!/Eeble Freeble! edit?**

* **Eef Freef!** sbubbies are nonsensical, like [the original sbubby](https://redd.it/5e2gsk/). Examples are randomly rearranged letters (such as "Subway" edited into "Sbubby"), repeated letters or patterns (such as "AAAAAAAAA"), or anything else that is nonsensical.

* **Eeble Freeble!** sbubbies, aka squbbly, is pretty much a surreal sbubby with unusual changes to the logo, such as cleanly distorted text which creates some random shape, pattern, or otherwise surreal mess. See [the original squbbly by Thomilo44](https://redd.it/8wlloq/) for a reference idea.

* **Eaten Fresh!** sbubbies have the same concept of editing, except their text makes some sense or has some meaning.

* **Logoswap** is a subcategory of Eaten Fresh!, but for swapping brand names of logos with another.
